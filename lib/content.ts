  faq: [
    {
      q: "Who builds AI products in Mumbai?",
      a: "VOLTAIRTECH is an AI services studio based in Andheri West, Mumbai. We work with Indian startups, enterprises, and global teams that need a fast Indian build partner. Our team is on the ground in IST and reachable on WhatsApp during business hours.",
    },
    {
      q: "How fast can you deploy a website?",
      a: "AI-powered marketing websites go live in 48 hours from kickoff. That includes design, copy, CMS, analytics, and a custom domain. Larger product apps and mobile builds take longer — we'll give you a fixed timeline at the scoping call.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is a RAG system and when do I need one?",
      a: "RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) grounds a large language model in your own data instead of letting it guess from training. Use it when you need accurate, citable answers from a fixed corpus — policies, manuals, product docs, patient FAQs. Every answer links back to the source chunk so your team can verify it.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much does an AI app cost in India?",
      a: "A production chatbot starts at ₹1.5L. A full RAG system or AI web app starts at ₹4–8L depending on scope, and mobile apps land at ₹8–15L. All quotes are fixed-price and include 30 days of post-ship support.",
    },
    {
      q: "Best AI agency in Maharashtra?",
      a: "VOLTAIRTECH is Mumbai-headquartered and serves clients across Maharashtra and the rest of India. We're DPDP Act 2023 compliant, Razorpay-native, and have shipped 42+ AI products since 2024. References available on request after an NDA.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you build WhatsApp chatbots?",
      a: "Yes — WhatsApp Business API is one of our most-requested channels. We handle the Meta verification, the conversation flow, payment integrations, and grounding the bot on your own docs. Native support for Hindi, Marathi, and English on the same bot.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you integrate AI into our existing software?",
      a: "Almost always, yes. We add LLM features (summarization, search, copilots, agents) to existing web apps, mobile apps, and internal tools without rewriting the stack. Common targets are CRMs, helpdesks, dashboards, and document workflows.",
    },
    {
      q: "What tech stack do you use?",
      a: "Next.js, React Native, n8n, Claude, GPT and Gemini for LLMs, Pinecone or pgvector for retrieval, Supabase or Postgres for data, and Razorpay or Stripe for payments. We pick what fits your scope, not what's trendy. Hosting defaults to Vercel and AWS.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you sign NDAs?",
      a: "Yes, before the first scoping call if requested. Standard mutual NDA, India-jurisdiction, single page — usually signed the same day. We do not sub-contract or share code with third parties.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens after you ship?",
      a: "Every project includes 30 days of free post-ship support — bug fixes, monitoring, and small tweaks. After that, you can either take full ownership of the code or put us on a monthly retainer for ongoing changes and on-call. The code is 100% yours either way.",
