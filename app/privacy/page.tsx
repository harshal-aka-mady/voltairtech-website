      <p>
        Voltaire Tech (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;) is an AI services studio incorporated in Mumbai,
        Maharashtra, India. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect
        personal data when you visit <strong>voltairtech.com</strong> or engage us for
        services. We comply with India&apos;s Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023
        and all other applicable laws.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only what we need to deliver our services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact details</strong> — name, email address, phone number, WhatsApp number — when you reach out to start a project.</li>
        <li><strong>Project information</strong> — brief descriptions of your requirements, timelines, and preferences shared during scoping calls.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data</strong> — anonymised analytics (page views, referral source, session duration) via privacy-preserving tools. No cookies that identify you personally without consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications</strong> — messages you send us via email, WhatsApp, or web forms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect payment card details directly. Payments are processed by Razorpay or Stripe under their respective privacy policies.</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>

        <li>To send project updates, invoices, and post-delivery support communications.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations including tax records and contract fulfilment.</li>
        <li>To improve our website and services using aggregated, anonymised analytics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will not send you marketing emails without your explicit consent. You can opt out of any communications at any time by replying &quot;STOP&quot; to any message or emailing <a href="mailto:business@voltairtech.com">business@voltairtech.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Under the DPDP Act 2023, we process your personal data on the basis of:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong> — when you proactively contact us or fill in a form.</li>
        <li><strong>Contractual necessity</strong> — to perform services you have engaged us for.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — for analytics and security, where these do not override your rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> — for tax, accounting, and regulatory compliance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Legal authorities</strong> where required by law or a valid court order.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sub-contract your project work to third parties without written notice and your consent.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain project and contact data for 7 years to comply with Indian accounting and tax
        law. Analytics data is retained for 24 months. You may request deletion of marketing
        communications data at any time. Post-deletion, some data may be retained in anonymised
        form for statistical purposes only.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Access a summary of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Correct inaccurate or incomplete personal data.</li>
